As an accomplished\r\n            Engineer, Ed has won several employer awards including the annual President's Excellence\r\n            Award in the Innovation and Technology category at Northrop Grumman. Ed and his team\r\n            played a critical role in the deployment of several systems engineering projects that\r\n            were utilized as part of the Northrop Grumman Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) program.\r\n                            </p>\r\n          <p className=\"about\">&emsp;&ensp;\r\n            Ed earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of\r\n            Pittsburgh. Early in his career, he had the opportunity to work as both a Mechanical and\r\n            Software Engineer at Design Integrated Technology. The company designs and manufactures\r\n            pressure vessels, industrial mixers, and propellant test equipment. Many systems were\r\n            integrated with Data Acquisition and Control (DAQ) programs that Ed developed using\r\n            LabVIEW.\r\n                            </p>\r\n          <p className=\"about\">&emsp;&ensp;\r\n            Ed later worked as a Mechanical Engineer for Mantech Test Systems, Northrop Grumman, and\r\n            Digital Signal Corporation. At each of these companies he designed mechanical systems\r\n            using AutoCad and SolidWorks which are 3D computer-aided drafting (CAD) software\r\n            applications. He oversaw the mechanical development from design to prototype, and final\r\n            production. These systems were later utilized by the US armed forces of The Army, Navy,\r\n            Air Force, and Marine Corps.\r\n                            </p>\r\n          <p className=\"about\">&emsp;&ensp;\r\n            Ed continues to utilize SolidWorks to design and fabricate new consumer based products.\r\n            With the acceptance of these products, he hopes to help those with hand dexterity issues\r\n            as well as reduce the amount of yard debris that is sent to Waste Management facilities\r\n            or landfills.\r\n                            </p>\r\n          <p className=\"about\">&emsp;&ensp;\r\n            Ed has completed previous contract work in which he developed and revised website\r\n            content files using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The ‘Holiday Wish List’ is an app that enables each participant to\r\n            add gifts to their list, and view or select gifts to give from the lists of other participants.<br></br>\r\n            The app will initially take the user to a <strong>Sign Up Form</strong> where they can join a group\r\n            of participants or proceed to a <strong>Login Form</strong> if they are already a member. After\r\n            successful entry, they can retrieve and add to their personal wish list, view the wish lists created\r\n            by other participants, and select wish list items to purchase from other participants. When an item\r\n            is selected from the list of another participant, the item is removed from that participant’s list.\r\n            However, the updated list showing the removal of the item is not visible to the creator of the list.<br></br>\r\n            The app is created using Node and Express web server. The wish lists are created/modified using\r\n            MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM. The HTML layouts utilize Handlebars templates to display the\r\n            data which is added and retrieved using Express GET and POST route methods.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </Col>\r\n\r\n        <Col size=\"md-3\">\r\n          <img src={wta_seoul1} alt=\"city and country information including weather forecast for Seoul, South Korea\"\r\n            className=\"img-thumbnail img-btm img-ctr\" />\r\n          <p className=\"about\"> <strong>Project Title: </strong>Worldwide Travel Assistant<br></br>\r\n            <strong>Application Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://ed-sivick.github.io/world-wide-travel-assistant/index.html\">Worldwide Travel Assistant Link</a>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/ed-sivick/world-wide-travel-assistant\">GitHub Link</a>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <strong>Project Description:</strong><br></br>\r\n          Business and leisure travel to many states or countries can be difficult if you are not equipped\r\n          with the proper attire, or knowledge of specific holidays in that area.
